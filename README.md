## Overview

This project is a realtime ML system that will predict short term crypto price movements. 


## Motivation

I have been working with ML models for a while now and I have a reasonably good understanding of the inner workings of models and pipelines. 
This project is an attempt to build an end to end ML system. How do I turn an ML model into a product? How do I deploy it? How do I monitor it? How do I scale it?

## Technologies
TBD
